# ocr2yomitan
Realtime Japanese OCR from **desktop** clipboard to web text output, for use with yomitan. Powered by Manga OCR.

The main purpose of ocr2yomitan is to extract text from apps, games and other sources to a constantly updated text format on a browser to be read by yomichan/yomitan.

It was created as a tool for Japanese learners that want to learn thrgouh games in Japanese, without having to use a mobile OCR or having to look up kanji by hand.
